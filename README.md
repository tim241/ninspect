# ninspect: (S)NES Classic NAND Inspector

## What it is

ninspect is a dockerized application that mounts  a raw, encrypted NAND dump from your (S)NES Classic Edition inside a
Debian container and gives you a shell to inspect it. It runs on all systems that support Docker, including Windows.

## How to use

- Use [hakchi](https://github.com/madmonkey1907/hakchi) to dump both your kernel and NAND
- Place kernel.img and nand.bin inside the nand folder of ninspect
- Install docker on your computer
- From the docker prompt, cd to the ninspect folder
- Run `docker-compose run ninspect` or simply `./ninspect.sh`

## Available commands

### listpartitions

Lists the partitions in the given logical volume image.

### extractpartitions

Extracts all the partitions from the given logical volume image.

### extractkeyfile

Extracts the key-file from the given kernel image.

### decryptrootfs

Decrypts the given rootfs image using the given key-file.

### mountpartition

Mounts the given partition image at the given mount point. 

### mountnand

This is done by the default CMD of the container. It does all of the above unless the resulting files already exist:

- Extract the key-file from kernel.img
- Extract a logical volume image from nand.bin
- Extract the rootfs and data partitions from the logical volume image
- Decrypt the rootfs partition
- Mount these partitions at /mnt/rootfs and /mnt/data, respectively.

### copygames

After mounting the partitions using `mountnand`, use this command to copy all the games.

### copydata

After mounting the partitions using `mountnand`, use this command to copy all the files from the data partition.

## FAQ

##### What are all the files in the nand folder?

- nand.bin: The raw NAND image. To be provided by you.
- logical.bin: The logical volume extracted from nand.bin.
- kernel.img: The raw kernel image. To be provided by you, or alternatively provide the key-file found within it.
- key-file: The decryption key for the rootfs partition.
- boot.bin: The boot partition extracted from logical.bin.
- data.bin: The data partition extracted from logical.bin. It contains your savegames and the configuration.
- private.bin: The private partition extracted from logical.bin. Usually all 0xFF.
- rootfs.bin: The encrypted rootfs partition extracted from logical.bin.
- UDISK.bin: The UDISK partition extracted from logical.bin. Usually zero-size.
- rootfs.hsqs: The decrypted rootfs partition. It contains the game ROMs, the emulator binary and more. This is a
SquashFS image which can also be extracted with 7-Zip, for example.

##### Why does the container run in privileged mode?

Because the decryption relies on loopback device functionality provided by the docker host.

##### What else is in the NAND dump?

- 0x100000 through 0x18BFFF: uboot
- 0x600000 through 0x8B2000: kernel

## Test setup

Tested on Windows 7 Professional x64 with Docker Toolbox, using Docker version 17.04.0-ce, build 4845c56

## Troubleshooting

When running on Windows, make sure you clone ninspect somewhere inside your user folder in order to enable mounting.
